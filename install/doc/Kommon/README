Common: Commonly used C++ Classes and CMake scripts.

------------------------
Section 1: Introduction
------------------------

(Kasper-)Common is the most basic module of Kasper that all other modules depend on, be it only because of
the common CMake build scripts, which are located in the subdirectory "cmake".
In addition to that, basic C++ classes are included, defining common constants and providing useful
IO, Logging and Math tools.

Section 2: What's Included
---------------------------

 - /boost
      Boost headers from more recent versions than the required 1.34 are deployed
      from this directory, if required.
      
 - /cmake
       CMake scripts required by Kasper's build system.
       
 - /config
      Configuration files (currently only the logger configuration)
      
 - /Configuration
      The KConfigNode classes: A data structure that can read (and write) XML, JSON and INI files
      make their contents accessible in an easy manner. These classes are to be replaced
      by Tabree.
      
 - /Exception
      Very basic exception classes, which custom exception classes used in katrin code
      can inherit from.
      
 - /Logging
      A logging mechanism which allows detailed logging to console
      or text files with a system-wide configuration.
      
 - /Util
      Several utility classes, mainly numerical and mathematical helpers.
