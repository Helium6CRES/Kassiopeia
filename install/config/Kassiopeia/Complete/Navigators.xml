	<!--
		description:
			this is the principal space navigator within kassiopeia.
			given a trajectory segment, it determines whether or not tracks enter or exit spaces or cross surfaces.

		parameters:
			name:
				the name of the navigator.

			enter_split:
				if true, the navigator will split tracks when particles enter spaces.

			exit_split:
				if true, the navigator will split tracks when particles exit spaces.

			tolerance:
				this is a dimensionless quantity used in two places in navigation:
				1)
					if the distance between an examined geometric object and a trajectory segment's initial point divided by the size of the trajectory segment is less than the tolerance, the object is ignored.
					this prevents roundoff and numerical errors from causing the simulation to think an object is being struck repeatedly.
				2)
					if the distance between a calculated intersection point and a geometric object divided by the size of the trajectory segment is greater than the tolerance, the object is ignored.
					this prevents roundoff and numerical errors from faking intersections where they do not occur.

	<!--
		description:
			this is the principal surface navigator within kassiopeia.
			given a particle state, it determines whether the particle has been transmitted through the surface or reflected from it, and what space it subsequently enters.

		parameters:
			name:
				the name of the navigator.

			transmission_split:
				if true, the navigator will split tracks when particles are transmitted through surfaces.

			reflection_split:
				if true, the navigator will split tracks when particles are reflected from surfaces.
