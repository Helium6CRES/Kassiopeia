		description:
			command object encapsulating a request to combine or change simulation objects.
			given an instance of a kassiopeia object, a string can be given to it to request a command.
			if a matching association between the string and a member function of the parent's class is found, a command is created which binds the parent, its member, and a given child object together.
			typically commands come in add/remove or set/clear pairs which compose objects together as in the example, or get/set pairs by which an object's configuration may be altered.

		parameters:
			name:
				the name of the resulting command object.

			parent:
				the name of the parent object.

			field:
				the name of the parent class member to use.
				available members depend completely on the parent's final type.

			child:
				the name of the child object to bind with the member.

		description:
			component object encapsulating the extraction of a component from within a composite.
			given an instance of a kassiopeia object, a string can be given to it to request a component.
			if a matching association between the string and a member function of the parent's class is found, a component is created which binds the result of calling the member function of the parent into a kassiopeia object.
			typically components are built from getter functions, and may be chained together as in the example above.

		parameters:
			name:
				the name of the extracted component.

			parent:
				the name of the composite.

			field:
				the name of the class member to use.
				available members depend completely on the parent's final type.
