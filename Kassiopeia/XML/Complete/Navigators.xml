		description:
			this is the principal space navigator within kassiopeia.
			given a trajectory segment, it determines whether or not tracks enter or exit spaces or cross surfaces.

		parameters:
			name:
				the name of the navigator.

			enter_split:
				if true, the navigator will split tracks when particles enter spaces.

			exit_split:
				if true, the navigator will split tracks when particles exit spaces.

			fail_check:
				if true, additional calculations will be performed each step to find failures in the navigation state of the particle
				is disabled by default, as it increases the computation time of the simulation slightly

	<!--
		description:
			this is the principal surface navigator within kassiopeia.
			given a particle state, it determines whether the particle has been transmitted through the surface or reflected from it, and what space it subsequently enters.

		parameters:
			name:
				the name of the navigator.

			transmission_split:
				if true, the navigator will split tracks when particles are transmitted through surfaces.

			reflection_split:
				if true, the navigator will split tracks when particles are reflected from surfaces.
