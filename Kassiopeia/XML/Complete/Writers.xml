        description:
            a write condition for the root writer to reduce output file size while keeping tracking precision
            only every nth_step (int!) the root writer records a step

        parameters:
            name:
                the name of this write condition.

            parent:
                the name of the output variable which is used for the write decision (must be of type int)

            group:
                the name of the group the output variable is in (optional)

            nth_step:
                the fraction of steps to be recorded
